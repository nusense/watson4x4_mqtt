In this case both watson boxes are running on the same network
as is a beaglebone microcomputer (as beaglebone0.local)

The beaglebone has the "mosquitto" MQTT broker installed (via apt-get install mosquitto)
and uses systemctl to control it

### sudo su to be root

use
   systemctl enable mosquitto
to get it to start on reboot
   systemctl start mosquitto
to start the service immediately

root@beaglebone0:/home/debian# systemctl status mosquitto
